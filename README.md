## Brief

Attached (code-test.sketch) is a Sketch File of a simple (fake) design, please code the design using whatever language/framework you like. The client has a large range of services that are already on another CMS, so we need to speak to their API to return the three listed on this page. The API can be found here: https://api.mocki.io/v2/561baaaa
Tasks:
• Send a message letting us know when you estimate to have the test complete
• Complete the code
• Deploy to your code to Netlify (Free service)
• Send the Netlify and GitHub URLs to us with a description of how you did what you did and why you did it that way.

What we are looking for:
• The ability to follow instructions
• Communication
• Problem solving
• The ability to match design to code
• Page schema
• Performance
• Reusability
• Any code is written in a structured easy to read and edit format.
• Ability to use Git & Netlify.
